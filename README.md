## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned using background-color and mix it with a picture, using filter and mix-blend-mode.

### Continued development

There is different way to find the solution to mix background and picture. Find the best way is not that simple.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
